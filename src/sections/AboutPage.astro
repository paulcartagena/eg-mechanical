          I'm Victor, born and raised in Virginia. Over the last 12 years I've
          worked for local businesses as I gained experience and honed my craft,
          it always felt like family. Everything changed when one after the
          other each company began being bought out. The feeling, the culture,
          the values, all shifted. I realized I could not be part of something
          that went against my morals anymore.
        </p>

        <p class="opacity-90">
          So at the end of 2022, I took the leap and started my own business, <span
            class="text-blue-400 font-semibold"
            >Focusing on HVAC and Plumbing.</span
          >
        </p>

        <p class="opacity-90">
          We handle diagnostic, service, repair, and replacement. But more
          importantly, we do it with <span class="text-blue-400 font-semibold"
            >honesty and integrity.</span
          > We stand behind our work. We wear shoe covers, keep things clean, and
          treat every home like it is our own.

        <p class="opacity-90">
          One of my favorite memories is sitting down to have dinner with a
          customer. It did not feel like business at all, <span
            class="text-blue-400 font-semibold">it felt like family.</span
          > That is what this work is about to me, <span

            >real people and real connections.</span
